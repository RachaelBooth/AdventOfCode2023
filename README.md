## README

Advent of code is an excellent set of programming puzzles released from 1st - 25th December each year at [adventofcode.com](adventofcode.com).

Typescript rather than C# for me this year, because I fancied something different and also less to install on my machine.

If you're not me and looking at this for some reason, this is single use code - judge it as such!

To remind me;

`npm run solve`: Run solution for today's part 2
`--` to provide arguments
`-d n` to run day n
`-o` to run part 1
`-i test` to use input file test.txt

Input files go in `/inputs`, Solutions in `/src/dayN.ts` with async `solve1` and `solve2` functions taking in the filename.
